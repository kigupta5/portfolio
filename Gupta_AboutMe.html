      <!--Paragraph 1-->
      <p>Hello! I am currently a junior and Dublin High School. My interest in engineering started with my first interaction with code in elementary school. Every Tuesday and Thursday we would learn computer programming. It was a simple program where we would move a turtle around. I remember how fascinating it was to me that we could put the pen down or up, change the color of the line, and draw any shape I desired by altering the direction of the turtle. I always looked forward to Tuesdays and Thursdays. Then it was my first circuit. It was a workshop in a museum we had travelled to. My partner and I had to work together to make a circuit that could behave as a light switch out of tape, wires, a battery, and an LED. After a few minutes, my partner and I were the first ones to complete our circuit and we went and helped our classmates with theirs. I remember how I had just spent a few minutes admiring our completed circuit and the fact that the LED could turn on and off on my command. A few years later, when I entered highschool, I knew exactly what I wanted to be as I reflected on these memories - an engineer.

      <!--Paragraph 2-->
      I work towards my goal of furthering my knowledge in electrical engineering and computer science through involving myself in programs such as the engineering academy(DEDA) and taking classes such as Computer Information Systems at my local community college. In addition, I try to delve into the world of engineering through a multitude of extracurricular programs: Chicktech, Technovation, The Congressional App Challenge, my schools Mentorship Program, and the Alameda County Science Fair. With a few peers of mine, I am working to create an app to streamline the volunteer process in my school. I volunteer at the Alameda County Library as an Ebook helper to assist seniors in using the digital apps Libby, Overdrive, and RB Digital as well as troubleshooting any problems. I am also an engineering peer tutor for the engineering academy to aid my peers in any questions they may have in their projects during lunch. I enjoy working on and brainstorming applications in my freetime and hope to release my own application in the future.
     <br>

     <!--Paragraph 3-->
     I like to invest time in extracurriculars and pursue my hobbies. I enjoy drawing, photography, reading and crafts to nurture my creativity. I am on Junior Varsity Lacrosse which constantly requires me to work with my peers while playing the game. Lacrosse requires quick thinking and awareness in a high pressure situation, but with teammates to rely on the game is very enjoyable. Another activity I enjoy is classical dance. As a classical dancer for 9 years, much of my life has been dedicated to dance. I require precision and discipline while dancing to properly convey my hand gestures and keep to the rhythm of my songs. With the persistence I have aquired from dance I have learned that, as Shakespeare said, "the world's a stage", and I am willing to put in full effort into the tasks I perform on and off stage. I have also created an Instagram account to serve as an art portfolio of the artwork I create in my freetime. 
     <br>

     <!--Paragraph 4-->
     I hope to always be able expand my knowledge in college and even in my career in the future. My overarching career goal is to make an impact in the world. Technology is a growing enterprise that is allowing humanity to expand leaps and bounds beyond human imagination. There are so many fields to delve into, everything from electrical engineering to computer processing. I want to be able to contribute to this expansion of knowledge with my technological innovations; this is what motivates me in this field. There are 7 billion unique individuals on this planet and counting. But out of these 7 billion, only a few people are given the luxury of eternal life through legacy. My goal is to be among those names and technology is the key to doing so.</p>
