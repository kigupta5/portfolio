    <p>I am a junior and Dublin High School and, currently, my world revolves around two things: fine arts and technology. Now to others, this may seem like two completely unrelated topics, but for me, they are one and the same. As a child I enjoyed making things. I am a creative person, and the use of many mediums from clay to paint excite me, with all the possibilities it has. I eventually became infatuated with jewelry making. But that was not enough; I wanted my creation to have more meaning, to be more dynamic. That was when I found out about electrical engineering. For me it was no different than jewelry making, yet so much more. Some simple wires no longer made inanimate objects, but whole circuits that could turn on an LED to power a computer. I work towards my goal of furthering my knowledge in electrical engineering and computer science through involving myself in programs such as the engineering academy and taking classes at my local community college. I hope to always be able expand my knowledge in college and even in my career in the future.</p>
