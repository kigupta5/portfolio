      <!--Paragraph 1-->
      <p>I am a junior and Dublin High School and, currently, my world revolves around two things: fine arts and technology. Now to others, this may seem like two completely unrelated topics, but for me, they are one and the same. As a child I enjoyed making things. I am a creative person, and the use of many mediums from clay to paint excite me, with all the possibilities it has. I eventually became infatuated with jewelry making. But that was not enough; I wanted my creation to have more meaning, to be more dynamic. That was when I found out about electrical engineering. For me it was no different than jewelry making, yet so much more. Some simple wires no longer made inanimate objects, but whole circuits that could turn on an LED to power a computer. The words I penned on paper told more than stories, but could run entire programs that were free to do anything I desired.
      <br>
      <br>
      <!--Paragraph 2-->
      I work towards my goal of furthering my knowledge in electrical engineering and computer science through involving myself in programs such as the engineering academy(DEDA) and taking classes such as Computer Information Systems at my local community college. In addition, I try to delve into to world of engineering through a multitude of extrcurricular programs: Chicktech, Technovation, The Congressional App Challenge, my schools Mentorship Program, and the Alameda County Science Fair. With a few peers of mine, I am working to create an app to streamline to volunteer process in my school. I volunteer at the Alameda County Library as an Ebook helper to assist seniors in using the digital apps Libby, Overdrive, and RB Digital as well as trouble shooting any problems. I am also an engineering peer tutor for the engineering academy to aid my peers in any questions they may have in their projects during lunch. I enjoy working on and brainstorming applications in my freetime and hope to release my own application in the future.
     <br>
     <br>
     <!--Paragraph 3-->
     I like to invest time in extracurriculars as well to be well-rounded and pursue my hobbies. I enjoy drawing, photography, reading and crafts to nurture my creativity. I am on Junior Varsity Lacrosse which constantly requires me to work with my peers while playing the game. Laccosse requires quick thinking and awaress in a high pressure situation, but with teamates to rely on the game is very enjoyable. Another activity I enjoy is classical dance. As a classical dancer for 9 years, much of my life has been dedicated to dance. I require precision and dicipline while dancing to properly convey my hand gestures and keep to the rythym of my songs. With the persistence I have aquired from dance I have learned that, as Shakespeare said, "the world is a stage", and I am willing to put in full effort into the tasks I perform on and off stage.  
     <br>
     <br>
     <!--Paragraph 4-->
     I hope to always be able expand my knowledge in college and even in my career in the future. My overarching career goal is to make an impact in the world. Technology is a growing enterprise that is allowing humanity to expand leaps and bounds beyond human imagination. There are so many fields to delve into, everything from electrical engineering to computer processing. I want to be able to contribute to this expansion of knowledge with my technological innovations; this is what motivates me in this field. There are 7 billion unique individuals on this planet and counting. But out of these 7 billion, only a few people are given the luxury of eternal life through legacy. My goal is to be among those names and technology is the key to doing so.</p>
