    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my work experince page! Scroll down to learn more about the volunteer experiences I have partaken in, the Field Trips I have gone on, and Influential Speakers that have occurred during my engineering journey. Although my current goal is to become an electrical engineer, I am always open to new fields of engineering and willing to learn from them to broaden my knowledge.</p>

    <h2><strong>Field Trips</strong></h2>
    <h5><strong>Nasa Ames Research Center 6/5/18</strong></h5>
    <p>The first field trip I would like to talk about is when I visited the NASA Ames Research Center. My class and I had gone into the wind tunnels in there and viewed how gargantuan they were. Then we also visited a few of their laboratories and computer rooms. I learned a lot about the simulations that NASA performs in their wind tunnel for many different types of vehicles. Throughout the whole tour we had a tour guide who explained to us the sites we were visiting. This trip was memorable as it was inspiring to see the functionality of technology used in NASA and to learn about another aerospace engineering and also the importance of  simulations.</p>
    <h5><strong>UC Berkley 10/20/18</strong></h5>
    <p>My second influential field trip was visiting UC Berkeley. In this field trip, we learned a lot about the Etta Kappa Nu club and branch in UC Berkeley. We were guided by two college students throughout the tour who showed us the building, their accomplishments, and told us a bit of history. They also assisted us in the activities we did, such as helping us with our code or our circuit. In this field trip, we learned that Etta Kappa Nu is a specific branch in UC Berkeley dedicated to software engineers. This trip was highly memorable, as UC Berkeley is one of my dream colleges, and to be able to take a tour of it was amazing.</p>
    <h5><strong>Waste Center 10/20/18</strong></h5>

    <h2><strong>Influential Speakers</strong></h2>
    <h5><strong>Aaron Pomerantz</strong></h5>
    <p>In this talk, I learned about how technology and the environment can co-exist in may ways. I was informed about how recent technology is being used to further discover more things about the environment. This talk was especially influential on me, as it introduced me to a new work in where I could, too, possibly use technology to learned new things about the environment or help it, instead of the typically world view that technology hurts nature. This talk has broadened by interest into the field of environmental engineering.</p>
    <h5><strong>Manard Holliday</strong></h5>
    <p>A prestigious man who had worked under Obama had came in our engineering class to talk to us about artificial technology. He have us a bit of insight on how artificial technology worked, and how useful it was for the real world. Then he showed us examples of where we are in the artificial technology field today. Now, this was the part that left the biggest impact on me, because I had never known we had reached so far. It also helped destroy the image that robots are violent machines that are going to end humanity. Instead, this presentation showed a more realistic view of all the lives robots can save and the benefits they have for humanity, which is very inspiring and hopeful for the future, as well as opening my eyes to the world of artificial intelligence.</p>

    <h2><strong>My Mentor</strong></h2>
    <p>My mother is my mentor. She introduced me to a world of creativity, and always motivated me to push my borders in order to succeed. I learned from her the importance or being able to think of creative solutions and she was the one who had also fostered my interest in making what I see around me, leading me to want to become an engineer. My mother is a self-hired tailor, and has taught me independence and self-reliance through watching her work every day and constantly meet new dealines. I learned from her dedication towards a project and personal goals, as well as persistence and to never give up, no matter what challenge I am given. </p>
