      <h3 style="color: #1c793fe7;"><strong>Mechanical Winch System</strong></h3>
      <h4><strong>October 17, 2018 to October 24, 2018</strong></h4>
      <p><strong>The Winch:</strong>
      Our objective was to create a prototype mechanical winch system that could lift 100 grams or more. I had helped my team design a mechanical mounting system for the winch. The main problem we had came across was trying to make the winch system so it would not move with the weight we had decided to use. To do so, we had to make the system heavy enough so it would be able to withstand the weight. I helped in the creation for the main frame as we had to combine Vex with materials that were not meant to be combined. This means that the holes would not properly line up for the screws, which it why I had to be creative in what parts I would choose and where I would choose to screw in the parts together in order to create a cohesive machine.

      <strong>The Simulation:</strong>
      Although I had provided some help in developing the winch system, my main job was to create the simulation that was also required to be made with the actual prototype itself. In doing so I learned critical thinking skills, as I had to use code to do something I had never done before, requiring creativity on how I would perform the task at hand. I had also learned perseverance, as many times my code would not function, and I would need to go back and forth between the GUI(Graphical User Interface) and the code itself to see what was wrong and how it could be fixed. The main problem I had struggled with was determining how to make the simulation rotate the "winch" to bring up the object all at once. It took a lot of creative thinking and eventually I was able to get the right equation and the right numbers so that the simulation would work as desired. This project helped me to develop my critical thinking skills under a time constraint, allowing me to be more efficently productive in the future.</p>

      <h3 style="color: #1c793fe7;"><strong>MIT App Inventor Project</strong></h3>
      <h4><strong>September 23, 2019 to October 8, 2019</strong></h4>
      <p>In this project we were given the taks to modify an existing project of our choosing. My partner and I had choosen the "Quiz Me" game; one would be asked a few questions arranged similarly to a quiz. We had decided that this game was quite simple, and decide to repurpose the code to create a jeopordy game instead. This required a lot more code to create all of the questions. I was reponsible for the code in this project. It was especially difficult to enable communication between screens as well as organize it in a neat manner since there were so many screens we required. We had a total of 16 screens with questions and one screen that was to serve as the homepage. My partner and I had to spend time outside of class determining how we were to get the score system to work with our database, as well as how to correctly arrange the app. I gained insight into the multiple trials programmers have to go through in order to finally get a sucessful trial. And even after we belived we had finished the code, we decided to take the game even further with a score system that could keep track of the questions answered correctly with databases. Overall, our game was able to function basically like Jeopardy, discerning right answers from wrong and pulling up the corresponding question based on the dificulty and category chosen. It was interesting to glimpse into the world of app development as well as beneficial to learn the importance of user input and implementing it into our game.</p>
